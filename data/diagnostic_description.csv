STAD,"WSIs with a lower survival risk of stomach adenocarcinoma from the primary lesion are generally associated with early-stage tumors, particularly TMN stages I and sometimes II, where the tumor is confined to the stomach wall with minimal or no lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis. There is usually an absence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and perineural invasion (PNI), indicating that the tumor has not yet begun to spread aggressively. The tumor cells are often well-differentiated, forming well-organized glandular structures with low nuclear atypia and fewer mitotic figures. Tumor margins are typically well-defined, with little to no invasion into surrounding tissues. The stromal reaction is mild, reflecting a limited interaction between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma. Necrosis and debris are minimal or absent, suggesting a slower-growing tumor with less aggressive behavior. These histopathological features are indicative of a better prognosis, with a higher likelihood of successful treatment and prolonged survival.","WSIs with a medium survival risk of stomach adenocarcinoma from the primary lesion typically exhibit moderately advanced TMN stages, such as stage II, where the tumor has penetrated the muscularis propria but has limited lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis.
